# roadmap
Roadmap node for converting waypoints to polylines. 

Takes hardcoded waypoints and fits lanes through thw waypoints via a Clothoid and/or Cubic spline fitting. The polylines are outputted as `roadmap_msgs/RoadPolylineArray.msg` on `/roadmap/polylines`.

Code documentation can be found here: [https://github.com/oscardegroot/roadmap/blob/main/roadmap/docs/html/index.html](https://github.com/oscardegroot/roadmap/blob/main/roadmap/docs/html/index.html)

## Installing
All components should be installed automatically using (to be checked):

`rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y`

The xml reader depends on http://wiki.ros.org/asr_rapidxml.

## Usage
To test the node, run
`roslaunch roadmap roadmap_test.launch`

You should see the following path in RViz.

The big cubes denote the input waypoints. All other cubes are fitted waypoints and the splines are visualized by the continuous lines. Each color represents a lane type (e.g., freeway, centerline and crosswalk).

For running the node with other ros nodes, use `roadmap.launch` and see `settings.yaml` for high level settings.
Currenly, the reader supports xml and yaml documents. See `maps/test_map.xml`, `maps/test_map.yaml` for example formats.

**Note:** Support for the yaml files is for backwards compatibility, but the xml format should be prefered.
